## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2017-01-22
### Added
- Default `language` option for client constructor.
- Client modules.
  - Separate components for each client with convenience methods associated with specific endpoints.
- Caching system for requests.
- More unit tests!

### Changed
- The World of Tanks Console client's factory method on the `Wargamer` class is now `WoTX()` instead of `WoTC()` in order to be consistent with the client slugs. The exported `WorldOfTanksConsole` client class remains the same.
- Changed Webpack's Babel preset setting to >2% usage. Node distribution now builds based on Node v4 compatibility only.
- `APIResponse#response` is now `APIResponse#body`.
- Client methods that weren't entirely asynchronous have been rewritten to be 100% asynchronous.

### Removed
- `APIResponse#url` removed since it's not consistent with SuperAgent's response.

## [0.2.1] - 2017-01-09
### Changed
- Publishing process.

### Removed
- Web distribution from version control. For real this time.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-01-09
### Changed
- `client.fetch()` is now a private method. Requests must now go through `client.get()` or `client.post()`. The `requestMethod` option is no longer available.
- Web distribution: the Wargamer object is now available as `Wargamer` or `window.Wargamer` (the name is capitalized).

### Removed
- Wiped out `.npmignore` in favour of `package.json`.
